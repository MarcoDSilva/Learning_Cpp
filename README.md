# Programming-Course-Exercises
Repository with the exercises am doing to learn C++

[**temperature conversion**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Learning_Cpp/blob/master/temperature_converter.cpp) - program that converts between celsius/fahrenheit/kelvin.

[**Multiplication tables game**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/multiplication_tables_game.cpp) - Multiplication tables game. User needs to have the correct answer 3 times to win, if he fails once, loses 2 points.

[**temperature**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/temp.cpp) - A simple representation of a weather temperature, where each 2 degrees are represented with "#" and if the temperature isn't even the remainder is represented with "+".

[**toy3**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Learning_Cpp/blob/master/toy3.cpp) - Game where the user needs to guess a number randomly generate between 1 and 100.

-----------------------------------

**Most basic exercises below**:

[**P1**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Learning_Cpp/blob/master/p1.cpp) - gets 3 names and 3 ages, compare the users and returns the oldest (if there is one between them), and how many users are of adult age. (18+)

[**pythagoras**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/pythagoras.cpp) - gets 2 legs to calculate the triangle rect side.

[**compare_ints**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/compare_ints.cpp) - Asks the user for 3 numbers and checks which one is the bigger.

[**IMC**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/IMC.cpp) - IMC calculator and verifies if user is around expected values.

[**secs_to_hour**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/secs_to_hour.cpp) - convert the input seconds to (hour/min/sec), with a while loop.

[**triangles sides**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Learning_Cpp/blob/master/triangle_sides.cpp) - checks the sides of triangles to return if it's equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
