[**pythagoras**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/pythagoras.cpp) - gets 2 legs to calculate the triangle rect side.

[**compare_ints**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/compare_ints.cpp) - Asks the user for 3 numbers and checks which one is the bigger.

[**IMC**](https://github.com/MarcoDSilva/Programming-Course-Exercises/blob/master/IMC.cpp) - IMC calculator and verifies if user is around expected values.
